# MicroDb

## A minimalistic library to use localStorage as DataBase i tried to come up with. I use the localStorage API on a regular basis when developing apps. So nothing special, but here it is...

### Get Started:

Start with creating a new **"DataBase"** and come up with a name for it as an argumenent

```javascript
const DB = new microDB('Users');
```
### Initialize DB

```javascript
DB.init();
```
